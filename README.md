#  Currency Converter Web Application

A responsive client-side currency converter that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another in real-time. The application utilizes modern web technologies and external APIs to deliver accurate exchange rates and an interactive user experience.

---

##  Project Overview

This project is a **client-side web application** designed to perform currency conversion using live exchange rates. It features:

- A clean, responsive UI built with **HTML5** and **CSS3** (Flexbox layout).
- Dynamic functionality powered by **JavaScript (ES6+)**.
- Real-time exchange rate data fetched from an external currency API.
- Visual representation of selected currencies with country flags using a flag API.

---

##  How It Works

1. Users input an amount and select source & target currencies from dropdown menus.
2. The application fetches the latest exchange rate from the **Currency API**.
3. It calculates and displays the converted amount instantly.
4. The corresponding country flags update dynamically based on the selected currencies.
